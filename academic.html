            This is a decidedly academic website. My weirder and more inscrutable site including fiction, sound
            design, and clocks is <a href="https://web.mit.edu/zyzzyva/www/">here</a>.

            I am a sixth year PhD student in the Brain and Cognitive Sciences department at MIT. Iâ€™m advised by
            Josh Tenenbaum in the <a href="http://cocosci.mit.edu/">Computational Cognitive Science</a> group. I
            also work closely with
            Jacob Andreas and the <a href="https://lingo.csail.mit.edu/">LINGO</a> lab. I earned my B.S. and
            M.S. in computer science at
            Stanford.

            I am deeply interested in the <b>relationship between language and general cognition in human
                minds</b>. How can we express such a broad swath of our thinking in language, from our quotidian
            intuitions about people and the physical world to our goals, plans, and abstract theories about how the
            world works? How, in turn, does language drive our downstream thought â€” how do we update our beliefs from
            what we are told, or draw on broader cognition to reason about and answer questions? And how do we
            construct
            <i>new</i> knowledge in language, from new concepts to entirely new sciences or theories?
        </p>

        <p>
            My research seeks to answer these questions using empirical human evidence and formal computational
            tools, including <i>probabilistic models of cognition, program synthesis, and statistical language
                models</i>. I dream of computational models that coherently integrate evidence from how kids learn
            language and how adults use it, as well as disparate theories from linguistics, cognitive science,
            and AI about how we think and make meaning from language. Iâ€™m also a writer. I love
            a heady and intimate sentence, and would like to build models that explain even a sliver of what
            we get out of ones as rich and unruly as <a href="https://app.simplenote.com/publish/Zyr2yb">these</a>.
